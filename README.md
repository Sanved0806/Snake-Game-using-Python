# 🐍 Snake Game – Python Turtle Project

## 🎮 Description

A classic **Snake Game** built using **Python's Turtle Graphics** module. Control the snake with arrow keys, eat the red food to grow, and try not to hit the wall or your own tail!

This game was created using **Object-Oriented Programming** principles, and it's a great demonstration of logic, animation, event handling, and modular code design in Python.
